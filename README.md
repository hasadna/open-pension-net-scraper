# Open Pension Scraper

[![Build Status][travis-image]][travis-url]

Just like [Open Pension Scraper](https://github.com/nirgn975/open_pension_scraper#readme),
this repo contains tools and [meta]data for the purpose of extracting publicly-available
online information to be used by Open Pension.

Unlike *Open Pension Scraper*, this repo deals with machine-readable sources (either via an official
API or through "XML/JSON scrapping").

Open Pension is a "Hasadna" project, aiming to reveal the secrets behind the Israeli pension market.

## Pre Requirements
